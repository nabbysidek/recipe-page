### What I learned

Working on this project with a mobile-first workflow for the first time has been an enlightening experience. Adopting this approach, I focused on designing the mobile version of the website before scaling up to larger screens. This method emphasized the importance of simplicity and prioritizing essential content, ensuring a clean and efficient user experience on small devices. It also helped me identify and address potential layout issues early in the development process. Additionally, I gained a deeper understanding of responsive design principles and CSS media queries, which are crucial for creating a seamless and adaptive web experience across different devices. Overall, the mobile-first workflow has equipped me with new skills and a fresh perspective on web design, ultimately making me a more versatile and effective developer.
